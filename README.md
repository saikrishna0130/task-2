DESCRIPTION
As part of my internship task at CODTECH, I was assigned to build a Speech-to-Text Transcription System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) techniques. The primary objective of this task was to develop a Python-based application that can transcribe short audio clips into accurate and meaningful text. In today’s fast-paced digital era, such tools are essential for increasing accessibility, enhancing productivity, and enabling faster information retrieval from spoken content. Audio transcription plays a key role in areas like journalism, education, customer service, legal documentation, and accessibility services.To implement this tool, I used the Python programming language due to its simplicity and extensive library support in the fields of AI and data processing. The core library utilized in this project is the SpeechRecognition library, which acts as an interface to various speech-to-text engines. For this project, I integrated the Google Web Speech API, a free and reliable cloud-based service known for its high accuracy in recognizing English speech.The tool is designed to accept short pre-recorded audio files (preferably in .wav format), process them through the speech recognizer, and convert them into readable text. The process begins with loading the audio file using sr.AudioFile(), followed by capturing the data through the recognizer and transcribing it using recognize_google(). To ensure robustness, the system includes error handling for unrecognizable speech and connectivity issues with the API. The resulting transcription is displayed as clean, readable output that retains the original meaning of the spoken content.For development, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a modern IDE that supports features like IntelliSense, integrated terminal, syntax highlighting, and virtual environment support. These features helped streamline the coding process and provided an efficient environment for testing and debugging.The transcription system has real-world applicability across many sectors. In the education domain, it can help students convert recorded lectures into notes. In journalism, it can be used to transcribe interviews or press conferences. Customer support teams can use it to document client calls, and it can also be embedded into voice assistant systems, transcription apps, and accessibility tools for the hearing impaired.Overall, this task not only strengthened my understanding of NLP and audio processing but also provided me with hands-on experience in integrating third-party APIs and developing functional AI-powered solutions. Completing this project has enhanced my practical knowledge in Python, audio processing, and real-time speech-to-text conversion—skills that are increasingly valuable in the modern AI landscape.
